In this project, I built a portfolio page to introduce myself to potential employers and showcase my work. 

The site includes: header/footer, navigation bar, an About Me section, and the links to five projects. 

The navigation bar includes links to GitHub and LinkedIn, along with shortcuts to email me or navigate to the other areas of the page. 

Since I don't actually have any projects in the portfolio yet, I used generic tech-themed photos. The first project is larger, per the assignment instructions. For now, they all link to my main GitHub page until I have completed some projects to take the place of the generic links. 

The site is fully responsive for all screen dimensions. This was achieved using flexbox to wrap the text and keep it in proportion. Media queries were also employed to change the flex direction of the top half from rows to columns, keeping the different sections arranged horizontally or vertically depending on the device so as to look nice and remain readable. The project links were also resized using media queries so as to take up more width on smaller screens, which rearranges them to have one project per row instead of two on mobile devices.
